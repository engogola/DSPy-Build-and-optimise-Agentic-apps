## 📚 About This Repository

This repository contains my implementation and learnings from the **DSPy: Build and Optimize Agentic Apps** course by DeepLearning.AI. The course focuses on building robust, agentic AI applications using DSPy's signature-based programming model.

## 🎯 Course Overview

DSPy is a flexible open-source framework that simplifies LLM application development by:
- Eliminating manual prompt engineering
- Enabling model-agnostic development
- Providing automatic optimization capabilities
- Offering modular, composable building blocks

## 🚀 What's Included

### Course Modules Implemented:
1. **Introduction to DSPy** - Understanding the framework fundamentals
2. **DSPy Programming** - Signatures and Modules implementation
3. **Debug Your DSPy Agent** - MLflow Tracing integration
4. **Optimizing Agents** - DSPy Optimizer for automatic improvement
5. **Practical Applications** - Real-world examples and use cases

### Project Examples:
- 🎭 **Sentiment Classifier** - Built in ~30 lines of code
- 🎲 **"Name the Celebrity" Game** - Interactive guessing application
- ✈️ **Travel Booking Assistant** - Multi-step decision-making agent
- 📚 **Wikipedia RAG Agent** - Optimized from 31% to 54% accuracy

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **DSPy Framework** - Core development framework
- **MLflow** - Tracing and debugging
- **Python** - Primary programming language
- **OpenAI API** - LLM integration
- **Jupyter Notebooks** - Interactive development


## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key (or other LLM API access)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dspy-course-project.git
cd dspy-course-project
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

### Running the Examples

Each notebook can be run independently:

```bash
jupyter lab notebooks/01_sentiment_classifier.ipynb
```

## 🎯 Key Learnings

- **Signature-based Programming**: Define what you want, not how to ask
- **Model Agnostic**: Switch between LLMs without code changes
- **Automatic Optimization**: Let DSPy improve accuracy automatically
- **Debugging**: Use MLflow for comprehensive tracing
- **Modularity**: Build complex applications from simple, reusable components

## 📊 Performance Improvements

| Application | Before Optimization | After DSPy Optimizer | Improvement |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Wikipedia RAG | 31% accuracy | 54% accuracy | +74% |
| Sentiment Analysis | Manual prompts | Automated signatures | More robust |
| Celebrity Game | Static responses | Dynamic reasoning | Enhanced UX |

## 🔧 Key DSPy Components Used
